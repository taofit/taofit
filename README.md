Hello, I'm Tao 👋

I'm a seasoned Senior Software Developer focused on delivering robust applications using Go (Golang) and TypeScript. I thrive on leveraging these languages to solve complex web challenges.

🚀 Exploring: Diving deeper into the React Native ecosystem as I work on personal projects, always refining my approach to modern mobile development.

🌱 work: Thrilled to join and contribute to collaborative teams in a challenging work environment.

🧠 Expertise: Ask me anything about large-scale TypeScript/JS/PHP systems, Go (Golang), or database design (SQL). I also welcome a chat about the benefits of meditation.

😄 Pronouns: Tao

📬 Contact: tao_sun@hotmail.com

Fun Fact: I appreciate a good, long walk for clearing the mind, and I often use my book collection as interior decoration until I find time for them!
