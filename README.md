### Hi there 👋

**taofit/taofit** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my side project in Golang and Fyne.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang, GCP and on the way to a professional Golang developer.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects in a new work environment.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with technical stuff that I do not know and eager to dig more into it.
- 💬 Ask me about Golang, PHP, typescript, javascript, sql, and some knowledge in other areas like menditation .
- 📫 How to reach me: tao_sun@hotmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Tao
- ⚡ Fun fact: like to take long walk, buying books and but not much time to read them all.
