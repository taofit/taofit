Senior Software Developer focusing on building robust, scalable applications with Go (Golang), TypeScript/Node.js, and AWS. I love tackling complex web and cloud challenges with clean architecture, event-driven design, and reliable systems that scale.

🚀 Currently exploring: AWS and working toward the developer associate certificate.

🌱 Currently working on: Joining collaborative teams where I can contribute meaningfully in fast-paced, high-impact environments.

🧠 Ask me about:

Large-scale TypeScript/JavaScript/PHP systems
Go backend development & microservices
SQL database design & optimisation
Cloud-native patterns on AWS (or Azure/GCP from past roles)
The unexpected calm that comes from daily meditation

😄 Pronouns: he/him (Tao)

Fun fact: I turn long walks into thinking sessions and use my growing book collection as unintentional home decor — one day I'll actually read them all!
